        an acquaintance cat (met the night prior) curled up on me the morning after
        <br>
        <br>
        saw a coot chick get picked up by a seagull from the water. a horrifying shared experience. seagulls gotta eat too.

        mmmm I want to see a hop/hoopoe this year, and maybe a meikever. and maybe get into bugs. there're like 20k species of insects in the Netherlands and I've only seen like 50 at most?!
