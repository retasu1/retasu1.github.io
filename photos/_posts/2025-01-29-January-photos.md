        Spring is happening. I know this because the alder catkins have bloomed and fallen. The geese are back and honking. The wild garlic are poking their little heads out of the ground.<br>
        <br>
        I am determined to notice Spring.<br>
        <br>    
        I'm unsure what to do with Instagram. I've been making monthly posts there for 5+ years. I would like to migrate this to my own website. As part of the blog? Or its own page?
