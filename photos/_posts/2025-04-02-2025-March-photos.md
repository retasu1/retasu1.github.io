            Spring! I want to lead these little tree walks in Delft and make that my whole thing. And look really closely at a tree and see who lives on it. And learn the different types of clouds.

            I'm taking a nature course and they're teaching us how to look at little creatures in water. What a world :D

            I've been posting on instagram first, then downloading my pictures from there since they make cropping easy. It's an okay workflow for now?

            I'd also like to make the UI clearer on small screens so that scroll-ability is indicated. üêå
