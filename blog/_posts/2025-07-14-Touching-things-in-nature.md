I was near the Schoorlse Duinen last weekend with a beach moment on Saturday (despite my Anakin feelings about sand). Jellyfish were washed up on the beach and I poked one on the bell (the bells don't sting - Finding Nemo). I also picked up and inspected a few hermit crabs that were getting pushed around by the waves, then put them back into the waves to be pushed around some more.

One thing I learnt about nature in the past few years is that you can touch most things without harming it or yourself. I've been touching and stroking and poking and feeling a bunch more stuff. It's a good time!

I also finally figured out how pine cones work and found (and ate) a couple pine nuts. I've been nibbling on more random things recently. A rose petal here, a dandelion leaf there. We've bred a lot of the "adult flavours" out of our crops I think. So far the pine nuts and a mulberry have been my favourite finds. Singular mulberry because I wasn't tall enough to reach any others.
