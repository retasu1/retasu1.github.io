I'm currently reading *Raven Biology of Plants* and *Always Coming Home* (Le Guin). I'm also committing myself to (tree) walks and activities even when no one joins. I'm also taking a mushroom course and going on walks trying to find mushrooms. And also looking for a job that's fulfilling and purposeful. There are like a million things I can learn and read and do, and then I also have to do the dishes.
