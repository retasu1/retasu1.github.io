Earthsea started it for me in 2049. I inhaled the first four books and came to the conclusion that I need to learn more names. I ought to know what I'm seeing and who is living around me.

Now I know more names, some in multiple languages, but there's always more to learn. It feels like I've been living in my own bubble, unaware of others around me. But now I see (some of) them. "Who are you?" I ask. How is your day going? Was the winter hard?

I write in circles.

Today I saw birds I've never seen before and I want to share.

I first heard about kievits[^1] in a [Taiwanese podcast](https://youtu.be/Nb3Glvjbbwg?si=Y-PbenbFAmS4mAk9) about how kievits are good ambassador birds for non-toxic farming (無毒農業). I looked them up and was surprised to find that they are common here in the Netherlands. Thus were they added to my apparent "birds I want to see" list. Now I am someone who has such a list.

I looked them up on [waarneming.nl](www.waarneming.nl) recently, and there are sightings super close to me?! So today I sought them out. It was easier than expected. There they were! Interesting wing shape in flight. Funny little hair thing. Not a fan of crows.

On the way back, we came across a couple pairs of spoonbills![^2] A placard stated they breed here every year. Practically my neighbours yet I've never seen them before. But now I have, and I'm happier for it.
