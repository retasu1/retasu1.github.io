I keep an eye on the [Forest and Nature Conservation Policy Group](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/environmental-sciences/forest-and-nature-conservation-policy-group.htm)  at Wageningen university. The current me thinks, if I ever do a PhD, it would be at somewhere like this. This group runs a [book club](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/environmental-sciences/forest-and-nature-conservation-policy-group/education/book-club.htm), and their next book is [*The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World* by Andrea Wulf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invention_of_Nature).  I doubt I'll attend the book club in person, but I did read the book. [^1]

Some disconnected thoughts:

## Dabblers and polymaths
Science wasn't always so specialised. I found this heartening, as someone who feels like they didn't specialise enough.

## Travelling by wind
It surprised me how it only took 41 days for Humboldt to cross the Atlantic (from La Coru√±a to New Andalusia). [Fair Ferry](https://www.fairferry.co.uk/) is planning a pan-Atlantic trip in 2025. If you're doing a straight across crossing, it can take as little as 18 days (see [this blog post](https://sailawayblog.com/sailing-across-atlantic/)).

## Women's magic, Thoreau, and Nature at home
Having recently finished [*Braiding Sweetgrass* by Robin Wall Kimmerer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braiding_Sweetgrass), I couldn't help but wonder if the revelations Humboldt made in South America could've been made at home too if he'd spent more time getting to know the people who knew and depended on the lands at home.

And then I thought of the saying in Earthsea, *Weak as woman's magic* (as well as *Wicked as woman's magic*). I always understood the difference between man and woman's magic in Earthsea to be cultural instead of inherent. Man's magic was (seen as) institutional and rational; woman's magic was (seen as) distributed and intuitive. 

Woman's science. Small science. Backyard science.

Earthsea's magic comes from deep knowledge of nature. The chapters on Henry David Thoreau and John Muir reinforced this thought, that surely if you spent enough time in nature that felt like home, you would understand the interconnectedness of it all.

[^1]: The physical copy of the book I read is a library book. The book is from Centrale Bibiotheek Leiden; I had to reserve it and they transported it to Delft. Wonderful how it all just works. Big fan of libraries. Prior to this, I hadn't borrowed a book from a public library in a very very long time.
