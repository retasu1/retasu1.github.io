I've been watching recipes from [this Taiwanese YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bewinoo). There is often an elaborate preamble about the origin of particular ingredients and their etymology.

In [this one](https://youtu.be/z1b-Sv52zDk?si=77wZC-TChyLcyMkr) (a recipe for egg in a tomato basket), he says that tomatoes used to be seen as poisonous! Small google lead to this [Atlas Obscura article](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/when-tomatoes-were-blamed-for-witchcraft-and-werewolves) about it.

On that note, I really like Atlas Obscura's font choices.
[Freight text](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/freight-text) and [Platform](https://type.today/en/platform)(? not sure the exact sans serif they're using, this one has a different 'a').
