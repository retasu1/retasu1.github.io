# Building and evaluating the performance and impact of emoji recommendation models in Discord

## Can emoji recommendations influence how people use emoji? What types of recommendations are most important?

### Project background

As more emojis are added to Unicode each year, the emoji keyboard becomes increasingly difficult to navigate. Users become unaware of all the emojis that are available to them.

For my master's graduation project, I worked on implementing models for emoji recommendation, which could introduce novel emojis to users depending on their current text input. The models were tested in an automated, Discord-based experiment operated by chatbots I made.
