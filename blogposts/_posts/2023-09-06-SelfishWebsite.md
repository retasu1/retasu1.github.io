This is now a GitHub Pages Jekyll Markdown website. I don't know all the implications of this, apart from the fact that whatever PHP I used was very convoluted. I thought about replicating the nav bar with liquid, but it felt hard and I began asking myself why I wanted to do it.

Oftentimes it's the challenge.

I made my original website towards the end of 2021, as a challenge, and because an online portfolio felt appropriate at the time. Almost 2 years have passed since.

Some highlights:
- Started dipping my toes into foraging. We made elderflower cordial/syrup, nettle soup, various wild garlic dishes, and some blanched common hogsweed.
- Did a traineeship, which, much like The Ultimatum (Netflix show), taught me a lot but I wouldn't go through it again.
- Got deeper into tabletop role playing games.

I want a space that was all mine where I can archive and document things. Ideas, recipes, books I've read, bugs I've seen. I want people to stumble on this website because of a niche google search that happen to match the keywords on a particular post. I want this to be something I can send to close friends
